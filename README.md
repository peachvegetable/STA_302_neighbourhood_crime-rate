## Overview
This repository contains a statistical paper delving in the Toronto neighbourhood crime rates, specifically the two chosen locatino Wexford and Kensington-Chinatown. By exploring the trajectory of the crime rates in these two locations, I found that the trend of each type of crimes is different in the two regions. Moreover, the overall crime rates exhibit an upward trend from 2014 to 2023.
