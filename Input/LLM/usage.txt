now I have wexford_rates_list, how do I use this list to create a table in the format: with years as rows and each type of crime as columns, where each cell in the table represents the crime rate for that year and crime type.

To transform wexford_rates_list into a table with years as rows and each type of crime as columns, you can convert the list back into a dataframe, ensuring the crime type and year are properly separated. Since wexford_rates_list is a named list where each name represents a combination of crime type and year (e.g., ASSAULT_RATE_2014), you'll need to split these names to create two columns: one for crime type and another for year.

Here's how you can create the desired table:

r
Copy code
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Convert the named list to a dataframe
wexford_data <- tibble(Rate = unname(wexford_rates_list),
                       Crime_Year = names(wexford_rates_list))

# Separate the Crime and Year into different columns
wexford_data <- wexford_data %>%
  separate(Crime_Year, into = c("Crime_Type", "Year"), sep = "_RATE_")

# Pivot the dataframe to get the desired format
wexford_table <- wexford_data %>%
  spread(key = Crime_Type, value = Rate)

# Make sure years are treated as numbers for proper sorting
wexford_table$Year <- as.numeric(wexford_table$Year)

# Arrange the data by year
wexford_table <- wexford_table %>%
  arrange(Year)

# Create a table using kable
kable_table <- kable(wexford_table, format = "html", caption = "your caption")

# Print the table
kable_table
